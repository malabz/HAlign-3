# Multiple Sequence Alignment with Suffix Tree

This project is aimed at improving a part of [HAlign2.0](https://github.com/malabz/HAlign), which could align multiple nucleotide sequences fast and accurately.

## Usage

```
java -jar halign-stmsa.jar [-h] [-o] [-t thread] [-c centre_index] [-r] [-s] infile
```

```
positional argument: 
  infile   nucleotide sequences in fasta format

optional arguments: 
  -h       show this help message and exit
  -o       target file
  -t       multi-thread
  -c       centre sequence index starting from 0
  -r       realign the endings for better results
  -s       output alignments without sequence identifiers, i.e. in plain txt format but with sequence order retained
```
